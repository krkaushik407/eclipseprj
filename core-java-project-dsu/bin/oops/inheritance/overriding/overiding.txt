/*
 * Method Overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific 
 * implementation of a method that is already provided 
 * by one of its superclass.
 * 
 * When a method in a subclass has the same name, 
 * the same parameters or signature, and the same return type
 * as a method in its super-class, then the method in the
 * subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.
 * 
 * Method overriding is one of the ways by which 
 * Java achieves Run Time Polymorphism.
