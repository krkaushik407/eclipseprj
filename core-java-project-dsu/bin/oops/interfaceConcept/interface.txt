Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~

Interface is contract / agreement that the implementing class 
has to provide implementation of the abstract method in interface

An Interface is defined as an abstract type used to specify 
the behavior of a class. 

An interface in Java is a blueprint of a behavior.

Interface contains static constants and abstract methods.
 
Interface is way to achieve 100% or total abstraction.

When we decide on a type of entity by its behavior and not by attribute
we should define as an interface.
