Encapsulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Encapsulation is hiding data from outside access.

To achieve Encapsulation we declare attributes as private
and provide public get and set methods to 
access the attributes.

public methods are called as getters and setters

getters are also known as accessors
setters are also known as mutators
