/*
 * Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, 
 * instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
 * 
 * Arrays contain only elements of same data type
 * 
 * Arrays once initialized the size is fixed
 * 
 * To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets
 * 
 * You can access an array element by index number
 * Each element is indexed in an array
 * Array indexes start with 0.
 * 
 * To change the value of a specific element
 * refer to the index number
 * 
 * To find out how many elements an array has,
 * use the length property
 * 
 * index of last element is arrays.length minus one
 * 
 * ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
 * The index is either negative 
 * or greater than or equal to the size of the array.
