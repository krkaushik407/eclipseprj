Object class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Object class is present in java.lang package. 

Every class has Object as a superclass
All objects, including arrays, implement the methods of this class

Every class in Java is directly or indirectly derived 
from the Object class. 
If a class does not extend any other class then it is a 
direct child class of Object and if extends another class then 
it is indirectly derived. 
Therefore the Object class methods are available to all Java classes

The Object class provides multiple methods which are as follows:

1. toString() method
2. hashCode() method
3. equals(Object obj) method
4. finalize() method
5. getClass() method
6. clone() method
7. wait() method
8. notify() method 
9. notifyAll() method

1. toString() method
Returns a string representation of the object.

2. hashCode() method
For every object, JVM generates a unique number which is a hashcode. 
It returns distinct integers for distinct objects. 
A common misconception about this method is that the 
hashCode() method returns the address of the object, 
which is not correct. 
It converts the internal address of the object to an integer 
by using an algorithm.

3. equals(Object obj) method
It compares the given object to “this” object 
(the object on which the method is called). 
It gives a generic way to compare objects for equality. 
It is recommended to override the equals(Object obj) method 
to get our own equality condition on Objects.
