Super Keyword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The super keyword is used to refer to the super class of a sub class

The super keyword is a reference variable that is used to refer to 
parent class when we’re working with objects.

Characteristics of Super Keyword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. super is used to call a superclass constructor: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When a subclass is created, its constructor must call the constructor 
of its parent class. This is done using the super() keyword, 
which calls the constructor of the parent class.

2. super is used to call a superclass method: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A subclass can call a method defined in its parent class using the 
super keyword. This is useful when the subclass wants to invoke 
the parent class’s implementation of the method in addition to 
its own.

3. super is used to access a superclass field: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A subclass can access a field defined in its parent class using the 
super keyword. This is useful when the subclass wants to reference 
the parent class’s version of a field.

4. super must be the first statement in a constructor: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When calling a superclass constructor, the super() statement must be 
the first statement in the constructor of the subclass.

5. super cannot be used in a static context:  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The super keyword cannot be used in a static context, such as in a 
static method or a static variable initializer.

6. super is not required to call a superclass method:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While it is possible to use the super keyword to call a method 
in the parent class, it is not required. If a method is not overridden 
in the subclass, then calling it without the super keyword will 
invoke the parent class’s implementation.
