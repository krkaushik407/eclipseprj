Default Access Modifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No keyword required

When no access modifier is specified for a class, method,
or data member, it is said to be having the 
default access modifier by default.

The data members, classes, or methods that are having 
default access modifiers are accessible only within 
the same package.
