/*
 * A method is a block of code to do specific task 
 * and it will run only when it is called.
 * 
 * method names should start with lowercase
 * avoid using underscore in between method names
 * method names cannot start with numbers, special characters like ! @ # % & etc.
 * method names can start with alphabets, underscore, dollar sign
 * we can use camel case for method names.
 * 
 * Why use methods?
 * To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.
 * DRY === DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF
 * 
 * A method must be declared within a class.
 * It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses () 
 * followed by {} code block
 * {} method implementation also called as method body
 * each method will have unique signature
 * 
 * concrete method
 * method having implementation is called as concrete method
 * 
 * abstract method
 * method not having implementation is called as abstract method
